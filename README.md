Super Hero App
==============

This is a repository of my Super Hero Web Application that I'm using as a learning tool for working with Durandal.js amongst other things.

The goal is to create a database of comic book super heroes as well as including recommended reading lists for each hero and an interactive timeline of major events.

Thanks,
